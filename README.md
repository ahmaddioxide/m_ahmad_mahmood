## Neumorphism UI and Rotatable Wheel

In this project, I created a user interface (UI) with a Neumorphism design style, emphasizing soft, tactile elements. This involved meticulously fine-tuning shadows, gradients, and colors.

Additionally, the project featured a rotatable wheel component, enabling users to interact with a circular number selector. Implementing this required touch-based rotation and accurate number selection logic.

The project combines Neumorphism aesthetics with an interactive rotatable wheel, enhancing the overall user experience.
